# Friendly Riot

The below document introduces you to our corp culture and goals. Please give it a quick read as it will acclimate you to our social space.




## Our mission statement
*Friendly Riot* is a place for players new and old alike to approach EVE with a mindset to treat the game as it is; as a game, where an individual's fun can be found in many ways, but ultimately the purpose is to derive enjoyment. If you log off for the evening feeling like you've spent your time doing what you wanted to do, our mission has been a success! Implicit in this goal, Friendly Riot prides itself in cultivating a welcoming atmosphere and low-stress environment.




## Culture and Etiquette
In Discord, Teamspeak, or any other communication platform we may use within the game, it is never okay to participate in or perpetuate (yes, even ironically):
* Racism
* Sexism
* Homophobia
* Transphobia

Some common instances of these and other things that might be okay in other places in EVE, but are not okay in Friendly Riot:
* Use of 'gay' and similar as a slur 
* Use of 'rape' as a synonym for kill/destroy/etc
* Use of 'retard' and similar
* Use of 'autistic' or similar as a disparaging slur
* Use of "REEEEE" / "autistic screeching" to express frustration (^see above)
* Use of "Jewing" or "goying" to mean ratting/krabbing or any other sort of anti-Semitism
* Xenophobia (see: sinophobia)




## Our hole and what we do in it!

We live in a C2 class wormhole with both a Hisec static, and a C3 static. This hole serves our needs as a lowclass corporation supporting a variety of activities both PvE and PvP. Some corp members may do indy, some corp members may krab, some may do PvP. Often they'll do all three, and more. The common thread is that we're doing it together.

PvP is encouraged and supported, and in-chain response for friendlies tackled or asking for help is expected. There are no mandatory PvP ops but group support is a must. To put it simply, no krabbing quietly to yourself while your friend is tackled, but you aren't expected to make PvP if you aren't looking for it.




## Things you must own

* Covert Ops Cloak capable scanning ship. Make sure you have at least one in the hole at all times!


## Things you should probably own

* Small-gang nano ships
* Interdictors/Interceptors
* Krabbing ships of your preferred flavor 
* A personal roller if you have a preferred fit
