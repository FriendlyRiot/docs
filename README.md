# Friendly Riot

The below document introduces you to our corp culture and goals. Please give it a quick read as it will acclimate you to our social space.




## Our mission statement
*Friendly Riot* is a place for players new and old alike to approach EVE with a mindset to treat the game as it is; as a game, where an individual's fun can be found in many ways, but ultimately the purpose is to derive enjoyment. If you log off for the evening feeling like you've spent your time doing what you wanted to do, our mission has been a success! Implicit in this goal, Friendly Riot prides itself in cultivating a welcoming atmosphere and low-stress environment.




## Culture and Etiquette
In Discord, Teamspeak, or any other communication platform we may use within the game, it is never okay to participate in or perpetuate (yes, even ironically):
* Racism
* Sexism
* Homophobia
* Transphobia

Some common instances of these and other things that you might have seen other places in Eve, but are not okay in Friendly Riot:
* Use of 'gay' and similar as a slur 
* Use of 'rape' as a synonym for kill/destroy/etc
* Use of 'retard' and similar
* Use of 'autistic' or similar as a disparaging slur
* Use of "REEEEE" / "autistic screeching" to express frustration (^see above)
* Use of "Jewing" or "goying" to mean ratting/krabbing, mentions of gaschambers, or any other sort of anti-Semitism
* Xenophobia (see: sinophobia)




## Our space and what we do in it!

We live in the Solitude fightclub, within blops range of all of Syndicate and western Placid, and a short jaunt from Gal/Cal facwar. We have access to many opportunities for roaming, fleet activities and solo play.

PvP is encouraged and supported, and response for friendlies tackled or asking for help is expected. To put it simply, no krabbing quietly to yourself while your friend is tackled.
