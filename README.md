# Friendly Riot

The below document introduces you to our corp culture and goals. Please give it a quick read as it will acclimate you to our social space.




## Our mission statement
*Friendly Riot* is a place for players new and old alike to approach EVE with a mindset to treat the game as it is; as a game, where an individual's fun can be found in many ways, but ultimately the purpose is to derive enjoyment. If you log off for the evening feeling like you've spent your time doing what you wanted to do, our mission has been a success! Implicit in this goal, Friendly Riot prides itself in cultivating a welcoming atmosphere and low-stress environment.




## Culture and Etiquette
In Discord, Teamspeak, or any other communication platform we may use within the game, it is never okay to participate in or perpetuate (yes, even ironically):
* Racism
* Sexism
* Homophobia
* Transphobia

Some common instances of these and other things that you might have seen other places in Eve, but are not okay in Friendly Riot:
* Use of 'gay' and similar as a slur 
* Use of 'rape' as a synonym for kill/destroy/etc
* Use of 'retard' and similar
* Use of 'autistic' or similar as a disparaging slur
* Use of "Jewing" or "goying" to mean ratting/krabbing, mentions of gaschambers, or any other sort of anti-Semitism
* Xenophobia (see: sinophobia)

Additional to the above, we do not ever wish ill on others in real life. For example, we don't tell people to "kys" or kill themselves, we don't deride people for their struggles in real life, and we don't doxx people. We maintain a healthy separation of ingame tribalism and chest-thumping from the very real and many times difficult trials of life.




## Our space and what we do in it!

We live in Scalding Pass, aka The Safari Zone, aka space Ohio. We take parts in all forms of PvP ranging from the nanogang scale to midscale fleet PvP. Kiting, brawling, and cyno-based gameplay are all on the table. We hold ourselves to personal betterment while also allowing ourselves the grace of learning, and simply having fun.

PvP response for friendlies tackled or asking for help is expected. To put it simply, no krabbing quietly to yourself while your friend is tackled.
